DOES:-
 1. PIECES... THE FIRST COLUMN SHOULD BE IN TEXT FORMAT'
 2. SHORTS... FIRST HALF OF THE FIRST SHEET SHOULD BE IN TEXT FORMAT
 3. MISSING... THE FIRST SHEET SHOULD BE AS IT IS COZ IT CONTAINS THE BUTTON FOR THE MACRO TO RUN FOR MISSING CODE...
	I DID IT BECAUSE THE USUAL SHORTCUT KEY WASN'T WORKING AS EXPECTED... IT WAS NECESSARY TO GIVE THE
	SHORTCUT FOR ABOUT THREE TIMES EACH FOR EACH WORKBOOK IN USE... I.E. PIECES, SHORTS AND MISSING BOOKS
 4. THE FILE LOACTIONS FOR THE FIRST TWO FILES SHOULD BE VERIFIEDALWAYS AND SAME FOR THE THIRD ONE BUT IN
	ANOTHER CODED MACRO

PROBLEMS:-
 1. FOR NOW THE SHORTS FILE SHOULD CONTAIN ATLEAST ONE SHORT IN EACH LOADKEY OR THE LOADKEY SHOULD BE DELETED...
	BUT I THINK ITS NOT NECESSARY TO LOG IT IN THE SHORTS FILE IF THERE'S NOT EVEN A SINGLE SHORT IN A LOADKEY
